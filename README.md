# React Router SPA Experiments
A collection of React Single Page Application (SPA) experiments built using React Router.  
This repository demonstrates core routing concepts including navigation, component mapping, and multi-page SPA architecture.
These experiments were developed as part of a practical lab to understand modern client-side routing in React.

## 🚀 Experiments Overview

### 🔹 Experiment 1 — Basic Client-Side Routing
**Objective:**  
Implement basic routing inside a React SPA.

**Summary:**  
This experiment introduces React Router fundamentals by mapping different components to routes. It demonstrates how navigation occurs without reloading the page.

**Key Concepts:**
- BrowserRouter setup
- Routes & Route mapping
- Component-based navigation
- SPA behavior
